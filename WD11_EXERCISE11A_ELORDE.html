            Leverage is an American action crime drama television series, which aired on TNT from December 7, 2008, to December 25, 2012.[2] The series was produced by Electric Entertainment, a production company of executive producer and director Dean Devlin. Leverage follows a five-person team: a thief, a grifter, a hacker, and a retrieval specialist, led by former insurance investigator Nathan Ford, who use their skills to carry out heists to fight corporate and governmental injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens.

            Season 1 consists of 13 episodes, which writers John Rogers and Chris Downey and producer Dean Devlin intended to be a complete story should the series not be renewed. Season 2, for which production moved from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon,[3] ran in two parts: a nine-episode summer season that premiered on July 15, 2009, followed by a further six episodes the following winter. Leverage moved to Sunday for season 3, which began on June 20, 2010.[4]
            
            Leverage was renewed for a fourth season on July 30, 2010.[5] It premiered on June 26, 2011,[6] and ran for 18 episodes, 10 in the summer and eight in the winter. The continuation of season 4 began on Sunday, November 27, 2011, at 9 pm EST on TNT.[7]
            
            On August 12, 2011, Leverage was renewed for a fifth season,[8] to be both filmed and set in Portland.[9] Season 5 premiered July 15, 2012.[10] Leverage was canceled on December 21, 2012, amid falling ratings.[11] The final episode, which was produced as a possible series finale, aired on December 25, 2012.[12] On January 9, 2013, Leverage won Favorite Cable TV Drama at the 39th People's Choice Awards.[13]
            
            A 16-episode revival titled Leverage: Redemption began shooting in early August 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana, with most cast members returning. It was released on IMDb TV in July 2021.
